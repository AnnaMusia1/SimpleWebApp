"index-1" file was created firstly, but then replaced with "index"

as index and about files share big part of the code, the "base" file is created to keep the repetitive code
so, basically it contains all the code from index and about, without the last line.
Instead of the last line, we put a placeholder:{% "block/endblock main" %}

Then, in index and about, we just need the {% extends.html %}
